Using Eletronic Sensors & Displaying the Results via OLED

In Code Folder, Full_Phatasm_Ardunio_V1.ino is the current mixture of all code for Sensors & other electronic equipment so far.
A lot of code was made from existing libraries in the arduino library 


Currently need to use a resistor to turn 5v to 3.3 for the OI Expander, else I receive ERROR : "A fatal error occurred: MD5 of file does not match data in flash!"
